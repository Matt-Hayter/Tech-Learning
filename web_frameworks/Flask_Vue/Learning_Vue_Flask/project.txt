Useful notes for project:

- Backend: Flask. Handles computation heavy code (on server, which tend to be faster computers), lay out routes and handle app's data and database (for each route and request)
- Frontend: Vue. Handles UI and interacts with backend. Still need to lay out routes.
- Using axios to connect frontend and backend
- Set up Vue using Vue CLI in frontend folder, named proj frontend
- Left .txt files throughout project to describe folder/file purpose
