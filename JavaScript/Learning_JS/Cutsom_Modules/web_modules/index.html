<!--html file for including modules-->
<!--defer/async tags:-->
<!--html files run from top to bottom, each time a JS script tag is encountered it downloads and then executes the JS-->
<!--Async tag allows for asynchronous download of all src items, with the items are executed in an order of first ready to last-->
<!--defer tag waits until html is completely parsed before executing the JS in order (not just by the first downloaded) -> useful-->
