// An abstract class contains at least one pure virtual functon. Base classes should be abstract

// Derived classes are abstract if they do not implement EACH pure virtual function.

// Derived class must implement EACH pure virual function to be instantiated (abstract classes can't be instantiated)

// -> Hence abstract classes cannot be instantiated

// If a derived class has a constructor (can be instantiated) it can't have a pure virual function (as this makes it abstract)
